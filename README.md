# Simple Machine Learning Library

This project implements a simple machine learning library in Java for binary classification. The library provides various classifiers, training and testing capabilities, and evaluation measures to assess the performance of the algorithms. A JavaFX-based GUI is also included for user interaction.

## Features

- **Binary Classification Algorithms**:
	- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
	- Perceptron
	- Logistic Regression
	- Decision Tree
	- Naive Bayes

- **Evaluation Measures**:
	- Accuracy
	- Precision
	- Recall
	- F1 Score
	- Confusion Matrix

- **GUI Features**:
	- Select input dataset (`diabetes.csv` or `breast-cancer.csv`)
	- Choose a classifier and set hyperparameters
	- Adjust train-test split percentage
	- Train the classifier
	- Display test results, including confusion matrix and evaluation metrics
